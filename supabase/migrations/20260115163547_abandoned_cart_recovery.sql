- refunded: Payment was refunded
- disputed: Payment disputed (chargeback)';

COMMENT ON COLUMN payment_transactions.abandoned_at IS

COMMENT ON COLUMN payment_transactions.expires_at IS
'When this pending payment expires (typically 24 hours after creation). NULL for non-pending statuses.';

-- 12. Update pending transaction handling
-- NOTE: The modification to process_stripe_payment_completion_with_bump() has been moved
-- to the original function definition in 20250103000000_features.sql for better organization.
-- This keeps abandoned cart recovery migration focused on its domain (tracking pending/abandoned status)
-- while payment processing logic stays in the payment processing function.
