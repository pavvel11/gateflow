## Security Best Practices

When deploying GateFlow:

3. **API Keys**: Rotate keys regularly and use minimal scopes
4. **Updates**: Keep dependencies up to date
5. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
6. **Backups**: Maintain regular database backups
7. **Monitoring**: Set up logging and alerting
