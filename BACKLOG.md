Built-in version management with one-click updates from admin panel. Automatic backup before update, health check verification, and rollback capability.

### Automated Review Collection
**Status**: 📋 Planned
Auto-request reviews after purchase, rich media support (photos/videos), display on product pages and checkout for social proof.

### AI Landing Page Generator
**Status**: 📋 Planned
Generate conversion-focused landing pages using AI. One-click generation from product name & description with persuasive copy and design automation.

### Outgoing Webhooks v2.0
**Status**: 📋 Planned
Auto-retry with exponential backoff, log retention policy (auto-cleanup), additional events (`subscription.started`, `subscription.ended`, `refund.issued`).

### Public Developer API
**Status**: 📋 Planned
REST API with API key management, scoped access (read-only, write), Swagger/OpenAPI documentation, and rate limiting.
